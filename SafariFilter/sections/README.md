**This filter is obsolete. It's not supported anymore and we do not recommend to use it. It was incorporated into AdGuard Base filter.**

It was a special filter for Safari 9 and above on iOS and MacOS to use in combination with AdGuard (or other) filter lists. It was needed as seperated filter because Safari's Content Blocking API does not fully supported AdGuard's advanced rules syntax. Now it is a part of AdGuard Base filter.
