! Blocking Firebase crash reporting is quite problematic:
! https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/1334#issuecomment-319302543
! ||app-measurement.com^
!
! Crashlytics is commented by @ameshkov.
! The reason for unblocking crashlytics is to not make developers life worse by breaking crash reporting.
! In a hostile network like when an ad blocker is present, apps might be crashing, and these errors need to be
! reported to devs, otherwise they won't learn about the issue and won't fix it.
! Also, it is not a common third-party analytics tracker, Crashlytics is not used for collecting users' data.

! start: Mail Tracking
! note that we don't use || prefixes because mail tracking pixels are often proxied by mail providers
! it's problematic that due to how Gmail proxy work, these domains aren't even exposed on the network level
! fortunately, extensions can see them (Gmail puts the real URL in the location.hash part of the src)
