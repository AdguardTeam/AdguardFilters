! *** Only for AdGuard MV3 extension. ***
! This file contains quick filtering fixes for popular websites that are duplicated in other filters. They are
! delivered faster than other filter updates because they don't require the extension to be updated.
! As static filters in the MV3 extension are only updated when the extension itself is updated, this can delay
! the update process for users, potentially exposing them to unresolved issues. This file serves as a quick-response
! solution to ensure that users of the AdGuard MV3 extension experience minimal disruption while waiting for
! the extension to update along with the static filters.
!
! Key points:
! - Purpose: This file is used to store temporary rules to address critical issues regardless of which filter is
!   causing the problem or the type of problem (e.g., missed ads).
! - Limited lifetime: All rules added to this file are temporary will be removed 14 days after they are added.
! - Flexibility: Rules can be added to resolve critical issues quickly, with no restrictions based on the source of the problem.
!
! To make it easier to delete rules in the future, they must be added with their date of addition.
