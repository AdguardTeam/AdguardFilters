! *** Only for AdGuard MV3 extension. ***
! This file contains quick filtering fixes for popular websites that are duplicated in other filters. They are
! delivered faster than other filter updates because they don't require the extension to be updated.
! As static filters in the MV3 extension are only updated when the extension itself is updated, this can delay
! the update process for users, potentially exposing them to unresolved issues. This file serves as a quick-response
! solution to ensure that users of the AdGuard MV3 extension experience minimal disruption while waiting for
! the extension to update along with the static filters.
!
! Key points:
! - Purpose: This file is used to store temporary rules to address critical issues regardless of which filter is
!   causing the problem or the type of problem (e.g., missed ads).
! - Limited lifetime: All rules added to this file are temporary will be removed 14 days after they are added.
! - Flexibility: Rules can be added to resolve critical issues quickly, with no restrictions based on the source of the problem.
!
! Limitations:
! Since version 5.0.185, when adding JS or scriptlet rules to custom filters, user rules, or Quick Fixes filter, only rules
! already present in the pre-installed filters will be applied. This means that before applying a rule, the engine will
! compare it to the rules in the pre-installed filters. If the body of the rule matches an existing rule in those filters,
! it will be applied. Otherwise, the engine will discard the rule.
!
! For example:
!  * If the Base filter contains the rule `#%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'canRunAds', 'true')` with any list of domains to which it applies, the engine will accept rules like `example.com#%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'canRunAds', 'true')` or `#%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'canRunAds', 'true')`.
!  * However, a rule like `#%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'canRunAds123', 'true')`, which does not match any rule, will be rejected.
!
!  In general, matching is done on a character-by-character basis. For example, these rules are not equal because of the different quotes:
!  - `#%#//scriptlet('set-constant', 'canRunAds123', 'true')`
!  - `#%#//scriptlet("set-constant", "canRunAds123", "true")`
!
! To make it easier to delete rules in the future, they must be added with their date of addition.
! When adding the first rule in a day, you must add a comment with a date.
!
! Rules added for frequently updated sites should be added to the section below the rest of rules.
