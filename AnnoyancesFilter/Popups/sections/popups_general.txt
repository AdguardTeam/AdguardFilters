! This section contains the list of generic rules that block in-page popups (like banners with special offers) and floating elements.
! At the bottom of this file, you can find the allowlist that fixes issues caused by the rules from this file.
!
! Good: any type of the rules will be good
! Bad:  example.org#@##credential_picker_container (should be in popups_allowlist.txt)

! "Sign in with your Google account"
! desktop
###credential_picker_container
! mobile

! Google Chrome may render the popup as a floating element which is not a part of the page
! that is why cosmetic rule `###credential_picker_container` does not work
