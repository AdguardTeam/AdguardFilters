# Contributing to AdGuard filters

If you want to make AdGuard better by creating new rules, follow the
instructions below to make your ideas come to life faster!

## Pre-requisites

- You need to have a [GitHub account][createaccount] to make contributions.
- You need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
  - [Git][git]
  - [Node.js][nodejs] (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
  - [Yarn][yarn] (you can install it using npm: `npm install -g yarn`)
  - [Visual Studio Code][vscode] (we recommend using this editor)
    - Install the recommended extensions for VSCode (listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`).
      - At first launch, you will be prompted to install them. If not, press `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and type
      `Show Recommended Extensions` and install them.
      - Please note that, by default Comment Anchors does not know adblock-style comments (like `! this is a comment`),
        so you'll need to add `!` as a match prefix in the `commentAnchors.tags.matchPrefix` setting
        (File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Extensions -> Comment Anchors Configuration).

## Setting up the repository

After you have installed the necessary tools, you need to set up the repository.

1. Fork the original repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your account.
1. Clone remote repository from GitHub to your local machine.
1. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   This will install necessary tools like [AGLint][aglint] and initialize [Husky][husky] hooks.

[husky]: https://typicode.github.io/husky

## Workflow for submitting changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes. Please use the following naming convention:
   `fix/123` where `123` is the issue number you're working on.
1. Make your changes, test them and put them in the proper file or section of the file.
   - You can learn how to write filtering rules in the [How to write filter rules][how-to-write-filters] section.
   - Please read and understand the current [filters policy][policy] we adhere to.
   - One of its most important points is the [quality requirements][qualityrequirements].
   - When you're done with creating rules, please take a look at the similar ones in the filters.
     This may help you to make a better version of the rule.
   - Please read the [Repository structure](#repository-structure) section below
     to learn more about the structure of the repo and where to put your rules.
1. If everything is fine, commit your changes. Please try to separate branches and commits
   for different issues and don't mix them in one. It is easier to manage and review them that way.
   - Note: By default, Husky pre-commit hook will run AGLint on your changes and will prevent you from committing
     if there are any errors in your changes.
1. Push your new branch to your remote repository.
1. Create a pull request from your branch to the `master` branch of the original repository.
   AGLint will run automatically on your PR and will report any errors.
   If there are any errors, fix them and push your changes to your fork.
   If AGLint passes, your PR will be reviewed by a maintainer.
1. If the review is successful, your changes will be merged into the `master` branch.

### Skipping checks

If you need to skip running checks, you can do it in the following ways.
Please note that it is only allowed in special cases and should not be used as a regular practice.

- Skip running Husky pre-commit hook: `git commit --no-verify -m "commit message"`.
- Skip running checks on GitHub: add `[skip ci]` to the commit message as a prefix.

## Repository structure

AdGuard filters are compiled from files in this repository. This is an automated
process that is periodically run by scripts in the [FiltersRegistry][registry]
repo. In this repository, each filter list is divided into several files, and
each file has its own purpose. If you're adding a new rule, make sure it is
added to the proper file or section of the file.

General requirements for submitting rules: don't add rules to the beginning of
the file, start entering them from line 4, for example. If you add rules with
a task comment or hints, put them next to the same structure in the file.
