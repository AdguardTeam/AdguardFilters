## How to write filter rules

Before you begin, please read and understand the current [filters policy](https://kb.adguard.com/general/adguard-filter-policy) we adhere to. One of its most important points is the [quality requirements](https://kb.adguard.com/general/adguard-filter-policy#quality-requirements-for-filtering-rules).

The next step is creating rules.
   * There is an [official documentation](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) that can help you.
   * When you're done with creating rules, please take a look at the similar ones in the filters. This may help you to make a better version of the rule.

## Repository structure

AdGuard filters are compiled from files in this repository. This is an automated process that is periodically run by scripts in the [FiltersRegistry](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry) repo.  In this repository, each filter list is divided into several files, and each file has its own purpose. If you're adding a new rule, make sure it is added to the proper file or section of the file.

General requirements for submitting rules: don't add rules to the beginning of the file, start entering them from line 4, for example. If you add rules with a task comment or hints, put them next to the same structure in the file.
